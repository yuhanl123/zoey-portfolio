## An outline
My final project is about college students’ mental health. The reason that I chose this topic is that I found out that due to the rising job seeking pressure, intense competition and other factors, many of my friends or some one I know has mental issues that troubled them. Therefore, I want to talk about this topic to let more know that we should take this problem seriously and it’s an important issue that can’t be ignored. 
## Structure
1. The overview of the mental health issues among college students：including the percentage of students who are troubled by similar problems, the historical change of this trend,what symptoms they encounter etc. 
2. Why the mental health issue is becoming more serious and prevalent in recent years: including what factors most affect their mental health, what’s the common reason that contributes to the issue, what kind of students are more likely to be affected by the mental health issue. 
3. How do they usually find help if they encounter similar problems: including how do they usually diagnose they encounter they have potential issue, what kind of sources they will ask for help, what kind of assistance they can acquire, whether it’s effective or not
4. What further steps we should take to prevent or help reduce these problems: including what kind of problems they encounter during the diagnosis problems, what kind of measure different parties should take to help them
