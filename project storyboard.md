## Wireframes and storyboards

I made the storyboard through the shorthand, currently it contains 15 pages include the main content, the overall flow is

- 1: showing the headline and introduce the topic
- 2: I will cite the comic paper to vividly show the common feelings among college students
- 3: Mental health problems among college students are worsening, showing the data and facts
- 4: Further share some data and facts about the seriousness of the situation
- 5:Major symptoms among mental health issues,using chart and text to show the different symptoms
- 6-8: using different font and chart to show the factors causing the problem
- 9-10: citing comic picture and image to show this problem is overlooked
- 11: using data to support the current help and resources are needed
- 13: point out what actions we can take

## User research
### a
For my research, the target audience will be college students and their family numbers, faculty, and relevant governors. Since my topic is about mental health issues among college students, I need to let college students know it’s one prevalent problem that should be addressed and brave to ask for help, let the faculty and family know they need to care for students’ mental health problems and provide sufficient help. While for the governors they need to invest more money in additional resources.

### b
The approach to identify individuals includes asking help from my surrounding classmates, faculty help. For the governor since it’s hard to approach, I ask advice from people who have more experience in working with the government, so I find relatives who have experience in working in the government.

### c
My interview script includes

Flow/Content: 
- Do you think the story conveys clear idea
- Do you think the story’s each page correlated to each other
- Do you think there are any missing information that you want to know but it doesn’t show
- Do you think think there are some information that are redundant 

Visualized/Interactive:
- Do you think the story has clear chart or word to illustrate the idea
- Do you think the layout is clear 
- Do you think the font or the color the image or chart is visualized
- Do you think the visualized chart show clear information 
- Do you think it’s aesthetically pleasing
Overall
- Do you have any other suggestions

- Overall findings: 

All the interviews mention “lack key information” or “lack correlated connection”, suggesting the overall content lacks important information to support the content and backup each page’s data, and some mentions don’t know the “main idea”, which may be caused that the first page’s title and following content don’t mention college students enough times, and it’s hard to know the main audience is college students. What’s more, many mention “the chart is not interactive enough”, since currently, the visualized data is mainly line chart and bart chart, it will be better if I try more forms to visualize the data. For the aesthetic part, many mention “the imbalance between background and main context”, I also notice that, one main reason is that I haven’t replaced the default picture so the context may not be visible enough. Another reason is that I haven’t highlighted or used different fonts to show the main content, the consistent font will make it hard to show the main idea.

- Next step:

Supplement more information to make the story more interesting and reasonable,  I will insert a transaction page in each part, and also supplement information related to why the mental health issues among college students are worsening.
I will replace the default background with the consistent theme or tone background picture, since the inconsistent background color will be distracted and not aesthetically pleasing
I will explore more forms to show the visualized data. The current form is quite monotonous and the legend title is not visible enough, so I will adjust the color and the title to make each chart clearly convey correct information.
