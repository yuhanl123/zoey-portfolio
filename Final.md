## Final deliverable
My final project is about talking about mental health issues among the campus. The main objective of my topic is about letting people know the issue is becoming worse among the young, and we should face the problem and talk about it directly. The campus should invest more resources into it. Based on that, the main audience of my project should be college students and relevant governors in the education system. 

According to the previous suggestions, what I should change is mainly about
Content: “lack key information” or “lack correlated connection”, to address this, I add subtitles in the first page to clear the main audience of my story to reduce confusion. What’s more, I also added a transaction page in each part, so I can let customers know there will be different topics after that.

Visualized: Many people suggest the chart I made is not interactive or clear enough, the main problem is that I didn’t insert the picture directly, and the title or label are not clearly stated. To adjust that, I first tried a different chart to show the information I want to show. 
Firstly, for the chart showing ⅓ of college students having felt depressed, I used Pictogram to show the number, so there is big contrast and a visualized icon to show the number.
Another chart shows the mental health symptoms prevalence, instead of using line chart to show each symptom’s trend, I just want to highlight the current year’s situation, I just used the bar chart to show it and reduce redundant information 

Aesthetic: According to the previous interviews, many people suggest the background color is affecting the content provided, and overall is not aesthetically pleasing. The main reason is that I didn’t carefully choose the background color and the contrasted text color, and the layout is messy. To improve that, I did the following things. I first chose the major themed color for my project, which is pink and blue, so I mainly used these two colors to make the overall content aligned. I also chose the dark background picture, so the white text will be more obvious to read. I also try to make the main content central in the page, so the overall layout is pleasing. Overall, it’s important to decide the theme color and layout at the first beginning stage, that will help to ensure there is not much color or inconsistency in the following page.
