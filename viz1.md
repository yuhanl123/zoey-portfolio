## The comparison
The three charts can be used to convey differnet messages. 
For the first chart, it can clearly show each country's latest year debt to GDP ratio, it can clearly show the difference between each country, but it can not show the ratio chagne of each country
The second chart can show the ratio change of each country, but since there are so many countreis so it can't compare each country's debt ratio
The reason to choose heatmap is that the chart can not only shows each country's ratio change, but compares horizontally to know which country has higher or lower ratio in each year, conveys more information in the easier way.
